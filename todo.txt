The UI should display a list of appointment timeslots from 9AM to 5PM

The timeslots should be in hour increments(9AM, 10AM, 11AM, etc)

If a user clicks on a timeslot, it should render a modal

In that modal window, the user is prompted to enter their name, phonenumber and hit submit

The timeslot the user selected is highlighted in red to indicate the slot has been taken

If the user current timeslot is clicked again, it render the modal again with the user info

From there, a user can edit there name and phonenumber
